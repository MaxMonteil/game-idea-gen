## What is this?

Welcome to a totally random game idea generator!
The premise is simple, keep generating new ideas untils you find an idea you love. Most of them won't make sense, what you can do is lock the words you like and let the rest of the sentence continue changing.

There are also some other settings you can play around with like the number of game genres, topics, or actions. Making things fancy will also generate adjectives.

### How does it work?

I'm using Sentencer to generate random nouns and adjectives plus my own list of verbs and game genres.

You can check the full lists and the site code over on Github.

## Getting Started

```
git clone
cd game-idea-gen
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

## Built With

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
* [Sentencer](http://kylestetz.github.io/Sentencer/)

## Todo

* [ ] Deploy as PWA
* [ ] Add a history to go back
* [ ] Make nicer checkboxes
* [ ] Add option to generate a setting (steampunk, space, middle ages, etc.)
* [ ] Make a logo (and favicon)

## Contributing

As you've noticed most of the ideas might not really make sense, feel free to make suggestions about words that should be removed or added to either list. Same for ideas about some extra features, let me know.
